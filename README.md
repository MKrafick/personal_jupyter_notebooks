# personal_jupyter_notebooks

This repository started with a jupyter notebook I have been working on to help assess databases for best practice and performance issues.
The notebook itself will require a variable file for values used in the connection string.

I hope to have more details and files posted in the near future. This is currently just a safe place to store things as I experiment and 
design more.
